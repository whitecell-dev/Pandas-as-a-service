## 📀 **ALBUM ART & PACKAGING**

**Front Cover:** A glitched-out terminal window showing the EDT kernel boot sequence, with DOOM's mask subtly reflected in the glass CRT screen.

**Back Cover:** Tracklist styled like a UNIX `man` page, with cryptographic hashes where barcodes would be.

**Inside Sleeve:** Graffiti-style diagrams of service lifecycles, looking like subway maps drawn by lambda calculus enthusiasts.

## 🎤 **LYRIC BOOK HIGHLIGHTS**

**From "Deterministic Bounce":**
```
[Connector]
I'm fetching data from the external source
With idempotent keys to stay on course
Persistent by default, I never sleep
Unless you set my flag, then reset's deep

[Processor]
I take your data, apply the transform rules
Pure functions only, I don't break the schools
Project and derive, select and refine
Your data's structure becomes more divine

[Router]
I read the conditions, evaluate the state
Pick the target service, don't be late
Start what's needed, stop what's not
Conditional routing's what I've got

[Monitor]
I watch the thresholds, check the bounds
When things look shaky, I make the sounds
One-shot or persistent, I've got the modes
Alerting you before it explodes

[Adapter]
I fire side effects, then reset clean
Unless you hold me, then I stay serene
Webhooks and outputs, I make the call
Then auto-stop, so I don't spam y'all

[CHORUS - ALL]
Deterministic bounce, tick by tick
Lifecycle managed, smooth and quick
From Lamport's time to Hoare's CSP
This architecture's running free
```

## 🎨 **ALBUM REVIEWS**

**⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Systems Architect Monthly**  
*"A tour de force of computational philosophy. Makes you rethink everything you knew about state management."*

**⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Functional Programming Quarterly**  
*"Finally, an album that understands monadic composition isn't just for academics. The production is immaculate."*

**⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️½ - Distributed Systems Digest**  
*"Loses half a star for being single-threaded, but gains it back for making determinism sound so damn cool."*

**"Underground Classic" - CS Curriculum Committee**  
*"We're adding this to the required listening. Students learn more from these 17 tracks than from 17 lectures."*

## 🎭 **MASK OFF: PRODUCER'S NOTES**

> *"Remember: ALL CAPS when you spell the man's name. But lowercase when you write the code. The mask isn't hiding anything - it's focusing everything. The architecture speaks for itself."*

> *"Special thanks to all the computer scientists whose work we sampled. Your ideas were the breakbeats, we just added the flow."*

> *"This tape is free to distribute. Copy the hash, verify the integrity, run it anywhere. The revolution will be executable."*

**BONUS TRACK:** "Live from the Browser Console" - 15 minutes of real runtime debugging sessions, complete with `console.log` ad-libs and unexpected `undefined` returns.
